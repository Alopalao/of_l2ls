Overview
========

The *of_flow_manager* NApp exports a REST API to add, remove, list and clear
flows from switches. It can be used by other applications to manage all flows.

This application creates an abstraction layer to other applications, since it
is only necessary to know the endpoints. The application handles the requests
and return the information already formatted (all endpoints that receive a
``GET`` return a JSON file).

Installing
==========

All of the Kytos Network Applications are located in the NApps online
repository. To install this NApp, run:

.. code:: shell

   $ kytos napps install legacy/of_flow_manager

If you are going to install kytos-napps from source code, all napps will be
installed by default (just remember you need to enable the ones you want
running).

How it Works
------------

A NApp that wishes to use this application can use http methods, such as
``GET``, ``POST`` and ``DELETE`` to request or send information to it. All
endpoints of this napp return a JSON response as described below.

``GET /api/legacy/of_flow_manager/flows[/dpid]``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns a JSON with all flows from a specific switch identified by dpid if
provided, otherwise returns all flows from all switches.

``POST /api/legacy/of_flow_manager/flows[/dpid]``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns a JSON with success message.

``DELETE /api/legacy/of_flow_manager/flows[/dpid[/flow_id]]``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns a JSON with success message.
